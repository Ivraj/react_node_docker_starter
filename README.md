# react_node_docker_starter

A starter repo for a CRA frontend with a Node.js backend. Both are run in
separate docker containers and controlled with docker-compose.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, you should be able to cd in and get going with the start.sh script.

```[bash]
cd ./react_node_docker_starter
./bin/start.sh
```

Boom, you're up and running. Customize the scripts in `./bin` to suit your workflow. Enjoy.
